PLAN:
{plan_summary}

RELEVANT CODE:
{code_context}

TEST FILES:
{test_context}

Evaluate the plan against these three criteria:
1. Requirement traceability: does the plan address every failing test?
2. Logical consistency: are there any contradictions or circular dependencies?
3. Feasibility: is the approach implementable given the existing code structure?

Respond in this exact format:
APPROVED: yes/no
SCORE: 0-10
FEEDBACK: <one paragraph explaining what is missing or looks good>
